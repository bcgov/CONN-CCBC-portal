# Growthbook
GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. 
In the context of our application, we use it as follows:

- **Feature Flagging:** Enables or disables functionality per environment (dev, test, and prod).
- **Banners:** GrowthBook allows setting values on features to be outside of true and false. 
  This allows us to create "objects" and read them in the app to set custom banners.
