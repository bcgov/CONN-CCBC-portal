# Creating a data dump with pg_dump

## Connecting to pod

Refer to the "Selecting leader pod in OpenShift" in [Process to Manipulate Data](./process_to_manipulate_data.md)

## Creating and downloading the dump

Once you've identified to the leading pod, you'll be in the position to dump the data. Using `oc exec -it <leading pod> -- pg_dump ccbc > backup.sql` will dump both the data and the schema to your local machine with the filename "backup.sql". To only download the data without the schema add `--data-only` after ccbc.
